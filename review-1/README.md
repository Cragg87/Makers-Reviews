**Notes made during the review**
--------------------------------

As a teacher
I would like to produce a report which takes a set of a student's grades
and produces a summary detailing the total number of each grade colour.

Grade types:
Green, Amber, Red

Example input: "Green, Green, Red, Amber, Red"

Output: "Green: 2\nAmber: 1\nRed: 2"

Possible errors: 
- for spelling mistakes add new category = 'uncounted' to report.
- lowercase entries should still be recognized.

Method takes string as argument, 
splits the string at the commas, 
counts the number of specified substrings,
returns a new string.

*Commits*:

I failed to make any commits during the review, though I had previously set up the RSpec project and pushed to Git. 

The commit ["First test passes"](https://github.com/Cragg87/Makers-Reviews/commit/f16929c8e2ad97d0e2f774fbc616358ef565470d) captures the extent to which I was successful during the review (i.e. not very!). 

Subsequent commits take the code much further, but were completed post-review based on feedback given.
